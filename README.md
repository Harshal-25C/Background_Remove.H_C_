# Background_Remove.H_C_

## Overview :
This Python script utilizes the `rembg` library to remove backgrounds from images. It provides a simple interface using `easygui` for selecting input and output files.

## Installation :
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required libraries:
```bash
- (1) pip install easygui
- (2) pip install rembg
```

## Usage :
1. Run the script.
2. Select the image file you want to process.
3. Choose where to save the processed image.

## Example :
Let's say you have an image `input_image.png` with a background you want to remove. After running the script and selecting `input_image.png` as the input file, you'll get a background-removed version saved as `output_image.png`.

## Notes :
- This script works best with images containing distinct foreground objects against a solid background.
- For complex images, manual touch-ups may be required.

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
